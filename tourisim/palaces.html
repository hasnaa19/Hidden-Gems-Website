<h2> Baron Palace </h2>

<img class="phiale" src="baron123.JPG" width="260" height ="240">
<p id="pe8">Baron Empain's palace, with its Indian style, and its tower stands out in the desert landscape, is distinct from the rest of the city. The palace reflects the high status of its owner and marks a major milestone in the urban landscape of Heliopolis. Baron Empain's palace is the most prominent Monuments in the capital.<br>It was founded by Edward Louis Joseph Empain between 1907 and 1911. He was a Belgian businessman who was awarded the title "Baron" by the King of Belgium.<br>The interior design of the palace consists of three floors topped by a roof. The palace is surrounded by a large garden from all sides. As for the basement, it contained a residence for the palace's servants, and consisted of a group of rooms connected by corridors and doors.<br> The palace building is surrounded by a spiral staircase and an elevator that connects all the palace floors with a basement.
<br>The ground floor consists of a reception room, a dining room, and a billiard room.<br> As for the first floor, it houses four rooms, each with its own balcony and bathroom. <br> Finally, the roof of the palace comes as an open space on one of the sides of the tower, characteristic of the Baron Palace.<br><br></p>

<img class="phiale" src="12.jpg" width="260" height ="240">
<p id="pe8">The palace was sold by its owners in 1957.<br> Forty years later and the sheen of this inimitable structure has gone. It hasn't just faded, it's been stripped away. Gone are the fresco murals and massive gilded doors.<br> Gone also are the balustrades, the beautifully designed parquet floors and the gold plated doorknobs. Even the famed Belgian mirrors were wrenched from their sockets.<br> Instead of guilded ceilings, bat droppings are everywhere making it impossible to believe this was once the nexus of economic power and the toast of the international café society.<br><br></p>

<p>Just one month before the official centennial celebrations of Heliopolis (1905-2005), Akhbar al-Yom (19 March 2005) announced that the state had recently acquired the Baron Empain Palace from its incumbent owners the Ali Reza family of Saudi Arabia, with the intention of turning it into a museum. As to how the palace was 'acquired' was not mentioned.<br>This announcement comes in the footsteps of the March 9-11 visit by First Lady Suzanne Mubarak to Belgium, the birthplace of Baron Edouard Empain. Mrs. Mubarak is the honorary president of the Heliopolis Association, a quasi watchdog group, which aims at maintaining and preserving the special character of the city of Heliopolis </p>

<h2>Abdeen Palace </h2>
<div class="leftfloat">

<img class ="phiale" src="abdeen.JPG" width="260" height ="240">

<p id="pe8">Abdeen Palace is a historic Cairo palace, and one of the official residences and the principal workplace of the President of Egypt, located above Qasr el-Nil Street in eastern Downtown Cairo, Egypt.<br>
Built by Khedive Ismail, to become the official government headquarters instead of the Citadel of Cairo, Construction started in 1863 and continued for 10 years and the palace was officially inaugurated in 1874.<br>
<br>the palace was designed by the French architect Léon Rousseau along with a large number of Egyptian, Italian, French and Turkish decorators.<br><br></p><br><br>


<img class="phiale" src="345.JPG" width="260" height ="240">

<p id="pe8" >The Abdeen Palace incident was a military confrontation that took place on 4 February 1942 at Abdeen Palace in Cairo, and almost resulted in the forced abdication of King Farouk I.<br> It is considered a landmark in the history of Egypt.<br>
<br>Following a ministerial crisis in February 1942, the British government, through its ambassador in Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, pressed Farouk to have a Wafd or Wafd-coalition government replace Hussein Sirri Pasha's government.<br><br>This reversal of long-standing opposition to the Wafd came from the British belief that the Wafd, still the most popular of the Egyptian political parties, would be more effective in gaining public support in Egypt for the British war effort than any of the other parties. It was also hoped that a Wafd government would weaken the influence of the pro-Axis elements around King Farouk.<br> Lampson eventually decided to force this choice on Farouk by insisting that he abdicate unless he agreed to ask the Wafd leader, Mustafa el-Nahhas, to form a government. Lampson sought and finally gained the support of Oliver Lyttleton in the British cabinet to apply pressure on the Egyptian King.</p>
<br><br>

<img class="phiale" src="34.JPG" width="260" height ="240">

<p id= "pe8" >On the night of 4 February 1942, General Robert Stone surrounded Abdeen Palace in Cairo with troops and tanks, and Lampson presented Farouk with an abdication decree drafted by Sir Walter Monckton. Farouk capitulated, and Nahhas formed a government shortly thereafter.<br> However, the humiliation meted out to Farouk and the actions of the Wafd in cooperating with the British and taking power, lost support for both the British and the Wafd among both civilians and, more importantly, the Egyptian military.<br><br> In his memoirs, Muhammad Naguib, one of the leaders of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and Egypt's first President, cited the incident as a major factor in the rise of revolutionary, anti-monarchical sentiment in the country that contributed to the Revolution 10 years later.</pe8>
